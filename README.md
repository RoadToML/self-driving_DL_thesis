# self-driving_DL_thesis
Repo for my masters thesis for a deep learning based self-driving car. 

The goal is to create a self-driving car model that, rather than dirving the car, will assist the driver incase the driver is not driving up to standards, or appropriately.
i.e. If the dirver is swaying within their lane, not slowing down for a intersection etc. 

Stuff to do:

+ init CARLA environment
+ add agents in CARLA
+ Collect training data from CARLA
+ Create appropriate R-CNN model (or other)
+ Figure out weight distributions for different data types
+ simulate 
+ ???
+ Graduate
